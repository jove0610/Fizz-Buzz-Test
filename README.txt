Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz"


This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3 it will print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 it will print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 it will print “FizzBuzz.”
